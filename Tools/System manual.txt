1. Introduction 
	It is not required to read this entire document to use the program, but if you don't read it and fuck up it's your own fault.

	Make sure you have the latest version of java installed. older versions may cause the program to malfunction.

	Keep in mind that a database file called "beer.db" will be created in the same directory as the program launch file, 
	DO NOT DELETE this unless you screw up and want to start over, everything regarding users, products and transactions
	are stored in this file, deleting it will result in a loss of all data.

	You may have to run the program as admin in order for it to run correctly.
	
	If you are experiencing any issues while useing the program that you can not fix by consulting
	this manual, feel free to contact me by phone or SMS at +45 71 20 20 03 and i will see what i can do.
	
	I highly suggest to restart the system running this program once a day.
	This have nothing to do with the program, but most systems run better if rebooted once in a while.

        Notice that inside the program, a "." dot will be used as fraction seperator insterad of a "," comma.

2. Setting up the program
	2.1 Initial setupp
		When launching the program for the first time, you will be prompted to choose a new database or an existing one.
		Choosing a new database will ask you for a name (Any normal filename without special characters is usable)
		choosing an existing database requires you to find it on your harddrive, normally it would exist in the same folder as the program itself
		
	2.2 Logging in as admin
		Click on the barcode image in the center of the screen and enter "OLProgram" as the password.
	
	2.3 Adding users
		There is two ways to add users:
		1. import users -> Use the userTemplate.csv to create a semicolon seperated file in Excel.
		2. Add users one by one by clicking "Add Users" and fill out the form.
		
		Notice: you must not leave any fields empty or the program may not function proberly.
		
	2.4 Adding products
		Add products one by one by clicking "Add Product" and fill out the form.
		
	
	2.5 Custom banner
		To use a custom banner, click the edit banner button and choose your banner.
		Changeing banner requires the program to restart to take effect.
		A custom banner should follow these specifications:
			- Width: max 100% of your screen width in pixels, but can be smaller.
			- Height: Suggested 1/4 to 1/3 of your screen height in pixels. 
			  The taller the image is, the less space there will be for the interface, 
			  so pick the height with caution.
			- The image file must be a PNG or JPG. For transparency use a PNG file. 
			  Larger files may cause the system to slow down slightly.
			  
	2.6 Advanced settings
		- Clear userlist: Removes all users from the list, including all transaction information.
		- Clear productlist: Removes all products the list, including all transaction information. 
		- Restore default banner
		- Restore developer banner
		- Clear user preferences: Removes all user set preferences such as custom banner and passwords
		- Add password
	
	2.7 Using the soundboard feature
		First, the built in soundboard currently only supports interrupting the music program SilverJuke.
		It relies on an open source project called AwesomeButton made by Martin Tange (https://github.com/mktange/AwesomeButton)
		The setup of AwesomeButton is not included with this system but can be found on GitHub.
		
		To setup the use of AwesomeButton inside this system
		1. Go to Advanced settings in the admin menu
		2. Set the IP and Port for the computer running SilverJuke and AwesomeButton
		3. Edit the products that you want to trigger a sound
		4. There are 3 options when editing the product
			i.   Enabling / disabling the soundboard feature
			ii.  The "soundstring" which is the command it sends to AwesomeButton. should be "hello" to play "hello.wav"
			iii. The "soundmod" which is the modifier on which the sound should be triggered. If it is set to 5 for a product
				 the sound will be triggered once 5 or more of this product is purchased
		5. When done editing, save and go back to the main screen.

		Note that only ONE sound will be plaid for every purchase. If a purchase is made that qualifies more than one sound to be
		triggered only the first sound will be plaid. To avoid annoying issues or overuse, AwesomeButton has a preset delay of 30 seconds
		between any soundrequests from the same source. 
		
	2.8 Changing database / Creating new database
		To change or create a new database 
			1. Login as admin
			2. Click Advanced Settings
			3. Click Change Database
			4. Restart the program and follow the instructions on the screen.

3. General use of the program
	3.1 Buying a product
		- Start by scanning a user barcode on the main screen
		- A new screen will show a user window with a shopping bag and some information about the user.
		- Scan any products barcode, if they are in the system, they will be added to the shopping bag
		- Scan ANY user barcode to logout
		
	3.2 Useing the multipliers.
		- When you wish to buy a large amount of one product, first scan the product, then a multiplier.
		- The multiplier does not multiply, but simply sets the amount of the previous scanned item
			- ex: Scan 1 beer -> Scan x30 = 30 beers
			- ex: Scan 3 beers -> Scan 2 ciders -> scan x10 = 3 beers + 10 ciders
			- ex: Scan 3 beers -> scan x10 = 10 beers
		- The max amount allowed is 30 for each product when you use multipliers. 
		- You can still add products above the 30, but this can only be done by scanning the product again,
		  but you will only add one every time you scan the product. The following example is still possible
		  even though it exceeds 30 products
			- ex: Scan 1 beer -> scan x30 -> scan 1 cider -> scan 30 = 30 beers + 30 ciers.
		- NOTICE THIS and inform your users:
			- Beer and soda crates contains 30 units
			- Cider crates containd 24 units
	
	3.3 Canceling a transaction
		- While a user is shopping, you can always scan the barcode "404" to clear your shoppingbag and logout
		  without buying anything. You are then required to log back in if you want to buy something.
		  
	3.4 If the program lock up
		- The program is designed to save the database after every action (when shopping after the checkout)
		  Therefore if the program locks up, no data will be lost, simply close the program by force
		  (alt + F4 or ctrl+alt+del) and restart it.
		- Exception: If the program locks up while a user is logged in, any products in his/her shoppingbag will
		  not be saved unless you manage to log him out before closeing the program.
		  
4. Editing and administration
	The following requires you to be logged in as admin.
	To log in click the barcode on the start screen, and enter "OLProgram" as password
	
	4.1 If a user loses his/her ID card
		- Find and select the user
		- Select the barcode field
		- Scan the new ID card
		- Click save and you are done!
	
	4.2 Counting products
		- Select the product you are counting
		- Change the number in the "Current stock" field
		- Click save
		- Repeat for every product
	
	4.3 Changeing total stock
		- Select the product you wish to change
		- Click the "Edit" button
		- Change the "Total Stock" Field. if you have bought more of the product, remember to add this to the old number or the waste will not be calculated correctly.
		- Click save and you are done!
		
	4.4 Removing a user 
		Warning, this removes any transactions for this user!!!!
		- Find and select the user you want to remove
		- Edit the user
		- Check the box "Delete" in the bottom left corner
		- Click save
		
5. Generate a bill
	To generate a bill correctly, ensure that you have counted the current stock of your products correctly.
	If current stock is not set correct, the program will not calculate the waste correctly
	The exported bill is seperated with semicolon, and decimal numbers are delimited by comma,
	this may be important depenending on the settings for the program you open the csv file in.
	I suggest that the file is opend in Microsofts Excel or similar.
